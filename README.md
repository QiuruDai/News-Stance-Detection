# News-Stance-Detection
This project aims to explore the question raised by fakenews challenge http://www.fakenewschallenge.org.

Bag of Word methods, tf-idf and Word2Vec, as well as language model are implemented to vectorise the documents. 
Several different distances (cos similarity, ect.) are extract as feature.
Linear regression and logistics regression are implemented to do the classification.
Xgboost is used to make the non-linear classifier.
All experimental results are compared and discussed in the report.

Please run run_this.ipynb to find more details.
